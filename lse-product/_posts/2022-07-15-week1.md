# üìù¬†Weeknotes #1 - Classic hello world

Hello world!

I have a longstanding habit of not sticking with regular writing projects, so I'm launching this in silence.  I've lost track of the number of times I've written a first post on a blog attempt. When I first joined the LSE Digital Comms team, there was an effort where everyone would have a weekly tracker -- less notes and more bullets. But the overhead of a new Word document every week, along with the relative lack of visibility of files in OneDrive, made it hard to keep the motivation up. Everything boils down to user need, right? Right now I'm feeling the need to both organise my own work and mind, and am feeling it will be useful to "work in the open" in a very tiny way. This is a kind of new year's resolution as my birthday was this week!

## This week

* First week back from holiday, which itself was the second time away in quick succession, due to double family holiday schedules and a friend's wedding being close together but not close enough to combine into a single trip, even with my generous higher ed leave allowance. It's proven a nice break, no real struggles with jet lag, and well in time to continue preparing for SoAY (start of academic year). SoAY for me is the busy in the run-up with new feature testing and release, and busiest during the influx of new student and staff users in September.

* Just before I left on hols, I put together a diagram trying to see what the overlap is for staff and student administrative needs at LSE. This week has been the first bit of showing and telling of that to a few individuals in Comms and DTS. It's by no means comprehensive, and the process has been useful to both gauge initial reception and get additional input on what it's gaps are and what supplementary materials are needed, particularly in reaching both technical and non-technical stakeholders. Already we plan to add personas, current technical systems, investment and support needs, and being explicit about what functionality is not in initial scope and what functionality is intentionally excluded and meant to take place elsewhere. This will be a good bit of work, but if possible we're aiming to get the package ready for Portfolio Board's September meeting, if we can hit all the checkpoints along the way. Here's a bird's eye view of the map in its current form:

* Being a bit meta, setting up weeknotes themselves, which I started on Friday afternoon. Having been a front-end developer for a decade, I have extensive experience with getting stuck in setup and decisions, which is why now I use the least effort thing I can find that suits what I'm looking for. I first was thinking of putting it on my personal LSE webspace as this will be work-related, and also no one will ever find it without being pointed to it. But looking for completely static site generators means setting up my work computer as a dev machine, and so far I've avoided doing that. Github Pages seems a good middle ground, and I was thrilled to find the [Welsh Revenue Authority's weeknotes](https://welsh-revenue-authority.github.io/weeknotes/) for an easy template. For actual writing, I started in Notepad++ but quickly decided I needed something easier to read and with spellcheck, so I fired up Simplenote for the first time in quite a while. It is easy to write and autosaves and syncs to my account, but there's an additional copy/paste step to actually get a note into a Markdown file. Confession: I'm much much more comfortable writing HTML than Markdown, so that's another thing I'm quickly having to pick up.

## Focus for next week...

The categories of the aforementioned weekly progress tracker were: Planned and done; Planned and not done (and why); Unplanned and done; Issues & blockers; Planned for next week. It was especially useful in setting out my todo list for the following week. So next week:

* I'm hiring for my team! So finalising that Digital Product Lead job description and moving it through the recruitment system to get the vacancy live
* Preparing papers and documentation for Portfolio Board for the portal proposal. 
* UAT (user acceptance testing) for the next release of Student Hub. We aim to release on 31 July with some new features for SoAY. Highlights are self-registration for staff users (currently a manual process!) and the ability to generate custom audiences by department/programme/year for events that go on students' calendars, especially useful for the Welcome period
* CDRs (career development reviews, basically annual performance review) season is here, so I need to prep for that

Thoughts on anything above, and motivation to keep going always welcome.

Cheers,
