# Weeknotes

This is a simple setup for publishing weeknotes on Github Pages, copied from the Welsh Revenue Authority's [weeknotes repo](https://welsh-revenue-authority.github.io/weeknotes/).

## Adding a new project

To add a new project, create a folder that contains a ```_posts``` directory and an ```index.md``` file. 

## Adding a post

1. Add a markdown file to the ```[project name]/posts``` directory with the format of 2022-01-01-week1.md
2. Add it to the ```[project name]/index.md``` file
